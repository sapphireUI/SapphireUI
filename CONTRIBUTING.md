# SapphireUI Contribution Guide

Thank you for your interest in contributing to SapphireUI This guide will help you understand how to add components, routes, exports, and other features to the project.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- Git
- Basic knowledge of Reflex and React

### Setting Up Development Environment

1. Fork the repository and clone it to your local machine
2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install reflex
   ```

### Development Mode

Buridan UI has a development mode that allows you to work on specific components without loading the entire library. Use the provided `dev.sh` script:

```bash
# Work on specific components
./dev.sh components sidebar cards

# Work on specific charts
./dev.sh charts line bar

# Work on both components and charts
./dev.sh both sidebar line

# Work on pro components
./dev.sh pro table

# Disable development mode (load everything)
./dev.sh off
```

## Project Structure

- `SapphireUI/`: Main package directory
  - `pantry/`: UI components organized by category (cards, sidebars, etc.)
  - `charts/`: Chart components (bar, line, pie, etc.)
  - `pro/`: Pro components for paid/premium features
  - `static/`: Static routes and metadata
  - `export.py`: Manages dynamic export of components
  - `templates/`: Base templates and layouts

## Adding New Components

### 1. Creating a Component

Components are organized by category (e.g., sidebars, cards) and version number.

1. Identify the category for your component
2. Create a new version file in the appropriate directory:

```python
# Example: SapphireUI/pantry/sidebars/v3.py

import reflex as rx

def sidebar_v3():
    """A sidebar component - version 3."""
    return rx.box(
        # Your component implementation
        rx.text("Sidebar v3"),
        # Component content
    )
```

### 2. Register the Component in Export Configuration

Update the `ExportConfig` class in `export.py` to include your new component version:

```python
# For a new version of an existing component:
self.COMPONENTS = {
    "sidebars": {"versions": range(1, 4), "func_prefix": "sidebar"},  # Update range to include your version
    # Other components...
}

# For a completely new component category:
self.COMPONENTS = {
    # Existing components...
    "new_category": {"versions": range(1, 2), "func_prefix": "new_category"},
}
```

### 3. Add Route and Metadata

1. Add a route to the appropriate route collection in `static/routes.py`:

```python
PantryRoutes = [
    # Existing routes...
    {"name": "New Category", "path": "/pantry/new-category", "dir": "new_category"},
]
```

### 2. Add metadata in the corresponding metadata file:

The metadata for components is managed through a special script in `export.py`. To update metadata after adding new components:

### Updating Metadata

1. Temporarily comment out the three export generation lines at the end of `export.py`:
   ```python
   # Comment these lines out temporarily
   # pro_exports_config = generate_pro_exports()
   # pantry_exports_config = generate_pantry_exports()
   # charts_exports_config = generate_chart_exports()
   ```

Then, go to the `staic/scripts.py` file and run the python`get_directory_meta_data()` function.
This will update the `static/meta.py` file with new meta data for all files and folders.

Make sure to uncomment out the exports after you run the script.

## Adding Charts

The process for adding charts is similar to adding components:

1. Create your chart in `SapphireUI/charts/[chart_type]/v[number].py`
2. Update the chart configuration in `export.py`
3. Add routes and metadata for your chart

```python
# Example: SapphireUI/charts/new_chart/v1.py
import reflex as rx

def new_chart_v1():
    """A new chart type - version 1."""
    # Chart implementation
    return rx.recharts.line_chart(
        # Chart configuration
    )
```

## Adding Pro Components

Pro components follow a similar pattern but go in the `pro/` directory:

1. Create your component in `SapphireUI/pro/[component_type]/v[number].py`
2. Update the PRO configuration in `export.py`
3. Add routes and metadata for your pro component

## Testing Your Changes

1. Run the development server with your specific component:

   ```bash
   ./dev.sh components your_component
   ```

2. Visit `http://localhost:3000` to see your component in action

3. Verify that your component renders correctly and works as expected

## Submitting Your Contribution

1. Create a new branch for your feature:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/new-component
   ```

2. Commit your changes with clear, descriptive commit messages

3. Push your branch to your fork:

   ```bash
   git push origin feature/new-component
   ```

4. Create a pull request to the main repository

5. In your PR description, include:
   - A clear description of what you added
   - Screenshots if applicable
   - Any special considerations or notes for reviewers

## Best Practices

### Component Design

- Follow existing component patterns for consistency
- Use responsive design principles
- Comment your code, especially complex logic
- Provide reasonable default values for all props

### Naming Conventions

- Component functions: `[component_type]_v[version]` (e.g., `sidebar_v1`)
- Directory names: plural form for categories (e.g., `sidebars`, `cards`)
- File names: `v[version].py` for version files

### Code Style

- Follow PEP 8 guidelines
- Use type hints where possible
- Format your code with Black before submitting

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **KeyError for a component**: Make sure your component is properly registered in the export configuration and has corresponding metadata
- **Component not showing up**: Verify that the route is correctly added and the component is exported properly
- **Development mode not working**: Check that your component name in the dev script matches the directory name exactly
